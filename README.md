### Purpose

This is a toy; it might be useful but is not intended for use.

Given an (optional) initial string of reservations and groups of various sizes thereafter, keep track of a venue's seating chart. Given the size of a group, find optimal (distance from stage center) seats for the group and reserve those seats.
